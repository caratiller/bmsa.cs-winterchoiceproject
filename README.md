# Age Caculator 
## Description
##### This program makes it so you can caculate your age by imputing your name and date of birth. In return it respons with Heyy (your name)!!!. You are (age) years. There is a code at the bottom (it is currently sitting as a comment) that we started to make if the code from the tutorial didn't work. 
## How to Run the Program 
##### To run the program you will need to press start and click on the "Name" box, this is where you input your name. Next you will need to click on the "Year" box and put the year that you were born. After that you need to do that step with the "Month" box(input the month as a number) and the "Day" box. 
## Help
##### If you run into the issue where the screen is blank then you can go into the code and on line 51 to 55 where the image part is a comment (I put it as a comment because it wasn't working) and take it out of the comment, run it(you will run into an error), and then put it back into a comment. I am not sure why it works when I do this but it does.
